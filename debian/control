Description: Centralized daemon to control your LIFX bulbs
 lightsd discovers LIFX bulbs on the local network and acts as a central
 point of control for them via a JSON-RPC interface.
 .
 The JSON-RPC interface can run over TCP, named pipes as well as Unix
 sockets and allows you to retrieve the state of the bulbs or set their
 colors. Effects, grouping and de-grouping operations are also supported.
 .
